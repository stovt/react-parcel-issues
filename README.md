# Parsel and React Context issue

Demo: [https://stovt.github.io/eact-parcel-issues/](https://stovt.github.io/eact-parcel-issues/)

This app demonstrates a bug with `parcel bundler` and `React Context`.

Everything works well locally. Only production build has this bug.

## Development server

Run `yarn start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `yarn build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy

Run `bash deploy.sh` to deploy the project to github pages. Also remember to change the repo link in the `depliy.sh`.
